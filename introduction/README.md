## Introduction to Cloud Computing

**What is cloud computing?**


**Cloud computing** is the **on-demand availability** of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically using a "pay-as-you-go" model which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for unaware users. [^1]

**Cloud computing** is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet** with **pay-as-you-go pricing**. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).[^2]

**Who is using cloud computing?**

Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as **data backup**, **disaster recovery**, **email**, **virtual desktops**, **software development and testing**, **big data analytics**, and **customer-facing web applications**. For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world.

The on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications through the internet.
- Access services on demand
- Avoid large upfront investments
- Provision computing resources as needed
- Pay only for what you use
