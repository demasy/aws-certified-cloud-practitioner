## Introduction to Cloud Computing

What is cloud computing?

**Cloud computing** is the **on-demand availability** of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically using a "pay-as-you-go" model which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to unexpected operating expenses for unaware users. [^1]

**Cloud computing** is the **on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet** with **pay-as-you-go pricing**. Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS).[^2]
